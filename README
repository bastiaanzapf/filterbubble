  filterbubble

An RSS Feed Reader, combined with a spamfilter.

1. Overview

Filterbubble is an application written in Ruby on Rails. It will read
URLs from RSS Feeds, download the documents, process them with XPATH
and then feed them through CRM114. State is stored in the Database and
displayed as a website. Users can Train CRM114 via a simple Interface.

2. Installation

2a. Ruby on Rails

You will need a working installation of Ruby on Rails. There is plenty
of tutorials.

2b. CRM114

Install crm114 via your package management. Or download and compile
the source from: 

http://crm114.sourceforge.net/

You should be able to run the "crm" command after that:

-----------------------------------------------------------------
> crm

Can't find a file to run,or a command-line to execute. 
I give up... (exiting)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

2c. CRM114 module

Install the Ruby Module via gem:

> sudo gem install crm114 

or

# gem install crm114

https://github.com/bendiken/crm114

This should be easy.

2d. Database

The Database structure was dumped to the file:

db/filterbubble.postgres.sql

If you're using postgres, you can just read that file. If you're using
a different database, it might be a little harder to get the Program
running.

The important tables are:

feed - RSS Feeds
format - algorithm='xpath', then parameter stores an xpath-expression
feeds_formats - links feeds to formats
meta - "Category groups" - often you will just need one of them
category - The point of this software.

When the database is empty, the website will display errors.

2e. further preparation

You will need ".css" files for CRM to run. You can create "empty"
(non-classifying) files with "cssutil" like that:

$ cssutil -b -r filename.css

css files are expected at crm-data/$meta_id/$name

where $name is the column "name" from table "category"

2f. Automatisation

In scripts/ there is a few usefuls scripts that can be run as:

.../scripts$ ./console < update

The scripts are:

update - download rss feeds, store new items
classify - download content, run crm114
train - train crm114 according to table "hints"

3. Running Filterbubble

When a few items have been read and classified (watch the script
output for error messages), the website will display links. It may
take a few hundred items of training until the results become
meaningful. With a few users and hundred items a day, this will take
a few days. Consult the documentation of crm114 for further advice.

before publication.

4. Caveats

I haven't been able to write a ROR "migration" so far. This is due to
my priorities.

For now, there is no "whenever"-Cronjob, because I did not have
opportunity to configure whenever correctly. You'll have to write your
own cronjobs.
